# Odin-calculator

A simple on-screen calculator can be used and operated like a real calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Handles divide by zero error
- Decimal point input
- Clear button to reset state
- Operator chaining (e.g. 5 + 3 \* 2 without pressing = each time)
- Repeat equals (pressing `=` multiple times repeats the last operation)

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic page structure.
- **CSS3**: For flexbox and styling the calculator.
- **JavaScript**: For the core logic, and event listeners for all the buttons of the calculator.

## Lessons Learned

- Managing state between first number, operator, and second number
- Handling edge cases (divide by zero, decimals, clearing state)
- Event listeners for dynamic UI interaction
- Improving user experience with operator chaining and repeat equals
